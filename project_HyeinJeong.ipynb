FPAs is known as a public procurement method with low cost and high transparency. Italy government switched their public procurement method from to FPAs occured between January 2000 to June 2006. However, the author argue that people miss some facts about FPAs. That is, high discounts at the awarding stage are obtained at the cost of excessviely favoring bidders might be problematic because in fact, the bidders are least likely to deliever what has been promised. Depending on the setup, this could mean a failure to respect the promised complement time, cost budget or work quality, all of which I will consider as measures of ex post contract performance."

    "- County of Turin: generated a smaller increase of the winning discount, in the order of 8 percent of the reserve price, and an increase in the extra cost and extra time that is one-third in terms of magnitude of that estimated for the Municipality of Turin, and not statistically significant."

    "- A. The Italian Public Procurement System\n",
    "    : With a few exceptions for military and strategic infrastructures, the procurement of contracts for the construction and maintenance of public works by all types of Italian Public Administration(PAs) occurs broadly under the same regulation. Contracts for public works can typically be procured exclusively through auctions based exclusively on price. Between 2000 and 2006, these auctions accounted for 79 percent of all procurements held and 82 percent of the total value of all contracts procured. As regards the auctions based only on price, two distinct mechanisms exist: first price auctions(FPA)and average bid auctions (ABA).\n",
    "    - Detailed explations about auctions\n",
    "        the process starts with a PA releasing a call for tenders that illustrates the contract characteristics, including the maximum price the PA is willing to pay (i.e., the reserveprice) and the procedure used (FPA or ABA). Then every firm qualified to bid for public contracts can submit its sealed bid, consisting of a discount over the reserve price.\n",
    "        -> FPA: the highest “responsible discount” wins.\n",
    "        -> ABA: the highest discount is always eliminated because there is a judgment of which discounts are not responsible is automated through an algorithm that discharges discounts greater than a kind of trim mean.\n",
    "- B. Timing of the Reforms\n",
    "    : In the period between January 2000 and June 2006, the regulation required the use of ABAs for all contracts with a reserve price below (approximately) €5 million. The European Union regulation mandates the use of FPAs for contract at or above this value.In January 2003, after a case of collusion in ABAs became public, the Municipality of Turin ruled to replace ABAs with FPAs for all contracts. Two months later, the same reform was followed by the County of Turin. Therefore, although the switch to FPAs is clearly not random, the fact that it occurred first in Turin and only years later in other similarPAs is due to causes unrelated to the effects of FPAs."
