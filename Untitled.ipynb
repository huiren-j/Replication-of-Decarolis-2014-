    "Decarolis examined the effect of the switch to First Price Auction(FPA) from Average Bid Auction(ABA) for public procurement in Italy. The main difference between FPA and ABA is the way to determine the winner. While ABA chooses the winner with algorithm to remove unreliable bids which sometimes results in removing the lowest bid price, FPA selects the lowest bid price as a winner. Due to high competitive chararcteristic of FPA, it is known as a good method for public procuremnet with a lower cost and high transparency. However, the author aruges that it is not the case when the object of procurement is a contract. To figure out it, he studied the effect of FPAs not only on winning price but also on performance quality and screening cost.  \n",

    "The results are obtained through a difference-in-differences(DD) identification strategy. It is applied seperately to two PAs,the County of Turin and the Municipality of Turin, that switched to FPAs in 2003. The observed period is from 2000 to 2006 and observed PAs are filtered by their reserve price above â‚¬300,000. As a result, the sign of coefficients were same in both PAs but the magnitude were different and even doubled in the latter. The author figured out that it is caused by screening process which delays the announce of the winner as excluding the most likely to be a winner but at the same time, the most unreliable bid. In the final part of this paper, the author used additional data about roadework jobs auctions from 2006 to 2011. This part showed the importance of the ex post bid screening for the effective use of FPAs by comparing the voluntarily switcher group and the switcher forced by the restriction on the use of ABAs.  \n",

    "The theorical background is based on \"auctions and Contract Enforcement\" of Spulber(1990). According to the paper, what differentiate auctions for contracts from auctions for goods is cost uncertainty because transaction in auction for contracts does not take place immediately. This characteristic of auctions for contracts gives the auctioneer different trade-offs between the savings due to a high winning discount and the losses due to poor performance quality.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "There are **Two types of Trade-offs**\n",
    "   *  The Trade-off between **the Winning Bid and Performance**  \n",
    "    : From high competition in FPAs, PAs are able to benefit with high winning discount. However, there is the risk that the winning firm will default intentionally to increasing their discounts as reported in Decarolis(2013) or the risk to lower performance quality and time delays.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "   *  The Trade-Off between **Performance and the Screening Cost**  \n",
    "    : There are three systems to avoid performance quality risk: financial guarantees to support bids, ex ante prequalification requirements for bidders, and ex post screening of bids reliability. The Italian system allows PAs to conduct ex post screening. Nevertheless, as the screening system ultimately lessens competition, equilibrium prices become higher than without the screening. \n",
    "\n",
    "To add more explanation about ABA, one of the main factors distinguishing ABA from FPA is the way to determine the winning discount. ABA remove all unreliable and risky bids. Thus the bidders offer higher bids than FPA and the bids tend to concentrate in a narrow range, near truncated mean. Therefore, the expected effects of a switch from ABA to FPA is to decrease of the price at the awarding stage, to worsen ex post performance and to increase bid screening.\n"
