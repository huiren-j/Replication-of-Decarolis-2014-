This repository contains my replication of:

**Decarolis, Francesco. 2014. "Awarding Price, Contract Performance, and Bids Screening: Evidence from Procurement Auctions." American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 6 (1): 108-32. DOI: 10.1257/app.6.1.108**
   
Decarolis analyzed the effect of the switch of Italian public procurement method to first price sealed bid acutions(FPAs) on public procurement performances based on the database of the Italian Authority for Public Contracts. This switch occured betwenn Jan 2000 and June 2006 for all their procurement of public works. FPAs are known as carrying benefits of low cost and high transparency. However, the author argues that it is not the case when the object of procurement is a contract.
