# Course Project: Replication of Francesco Decarolis (2014)  <a class = "tocSkip">
   
This repository contains my replication of:

**Decarolis, Francesco. 2014. "Awarding Price, Contract Performance, and Bids Screening: Evidence from Procurement Auctions." American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 6 (1): 108-32. DOI: 10.1257/app.6.1.108**
   
Decarolis analyzed the effect of the switch of Italian public procurement method to first price sealed bid acutions(FPAs) on public procurement performances based on the database of the Italian Authority for Public Contracts. This switch occured betwenn Jan 2000 and June 2006 for all their procurement of public works. FPAs are known as carrying benefits of low cost and high transparency. However, the author argues that it might not be the case when the object of procurement is a contract. The evaluations on the effect of FPAs should be conducted both at the awarding stage and at ex post performance. The results presents that possible trade offs due to adoption of FPAs and as a part of loss caused by this trade off, the author suggest the necessity of well designed screening process.

In this notebook, the replication of results and my extension will be presented. I added more visulization in the paper and also tried to check the assumption used in the model with additional data sample. I focused on the lack of randomness of this paper and the underlying assumptions to justify the lack of randomness. My extensions supports the author's argument.
