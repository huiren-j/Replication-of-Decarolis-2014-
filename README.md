Decarolis examined the effect of the switch to first price sealed bid acutions(FPAs) for public procurement on performances using data from Italy. Italy government switched their public procurement method from public administraions(PAs) to FPAs between January 2000 to June 2006. FPAs is known as a public procurement method with low cost and high transparency. However, the author argues that it is not the case when the object of the trade is a contract.
